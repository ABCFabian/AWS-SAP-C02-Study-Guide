# AWS SAP-CO2 Study Guide
The following guide is my attempt at helping myself and possibly others to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Exam.  I'd recommend taking Stephane Maarek's course [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/) and taking a few practice exams from [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Practice Exam](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-aws-practice-exams/) before moving onto the exam.  

Note: The author makes no promises or guarantees on this guide as this is as stated, a guide used by myself, nothing more.  This is a work in progress and I haven't passed the test, yet.

| ------------- | ------------- |
| Domain 1: Design Solutions for Organizational Complexity  | 26%  |
| Domain 2: Design for New Solutions  | 29%  |
| Domain 3: Continuous Improvement for Existing Solutions | 25% |
| Domain 4: Accelerate Workload Migration and Modernization | 20% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

## Organizational Unit (OU)

### AWS Account Organizational Unit Migration:
  * Remove the member account from the former organization [need root or IAM access to said member account and master account(s)]
  * Send invite to the member account from the prospective organization
  * Accept the invite from the prospective organization upon the member account
  * Ensure the OrganizationAccountAccessRole is added to the member account

### AWS Control Tower:
  * Easy way to setup and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment based on best practices and using AWS OU to create accounts
  * automates setup of environments in a few clicks
  * automates ongoing policy managment using guard rails:
    * SCP: preventative
    * AWS Config: detective
  * detects policy violations and remediates them
  * monitor compliance through dashboards

### Service Control Policies (SCP):
  * Policies for OUs to manage permissions within, helping accounts stay within control setting limits/guard rails
  * No permissions are granted by SCP, still IAM, but the effective permissions are the intersection of IAM, SCP, and IAM permissions boundaries allowing access
  * OU must have all features enabled to utilize.
  * Affects member accounts and attached users and roles within including the root user(s), not management accounts.
  * Doesn't affect resource based policies directly.
  * Doesn't affect service linked roles, which enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS OUs.
  * If disabled at the root account, all SCPs are automatically detached from OU under that root account.  If re-enabled all accounts there under are reverted to full AWS Access (default)
  * Must have an explicit allow (nothing allowed by default like IAM) which is similar to IAM permissions boundary (if not in boundary => deny)

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Allow vs Deny: If any denial in policy is present, the resource is denied regardless of allow statement(s).  The default behavior is to deny resource(s) and resource(s) need allow statements to be allowed.  

LDAP: software protocol for enabling the location of data about organizations, individuals and other resources in a network.  

Identity federation: a system of trust between two parties for the purpose of authenticating users and conveying information needed to authorize their access to resources.

User groups can only contain users

S3 Bucket Policies vs Access permissions:
  * Used to add or deny permissions across some or all S3 objects in a bucket, enabling central management of permissions
  * Can grant users within an AWS account or other AWS accounts to S3 resources
  * Can restrict based on request time (Date condition), request sent using SSL (Boolean condition), requester IP Address (Ip address condition) using policy keys
  * User access to S3 => IAM permissions
  * Instance (EC2) access => IAM role
  * Public access to S3 => bucket policy

| Type of Access Control | Account Level Control | User Level Control |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| IAM Policies | No | Yes |
| ACLs | Yes | No |
| Bucket Policies | Yes | Yes |

### IAM Credentials Report: IAM security tool that lists all your AWS accounts, IAM users and the status of their various credentials; good for auditing permissions at the **account level**

### IAM Access Advisor: shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last used; can use this information to revise policies at the **user level**

### AWS Policy Simulator: used to test and troubleshoot IAM policies that are attached to users, user groups, or resources.  

###  Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer:

### Identity and Access Management Policy Evaulation Logic:
![IAM Policy Evaulation Logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/PolicyEvaluationHorizontal111621.png)

### Amazon Cognito:
  * Web Identity federation service/identity broker handling interations between application(s)/resource(s) and Web IdPs.
  * Capable of synchronizing data from multiple devices by means of SNS to send notifications to all devices associated to a given user upon data deltas (IAM policy can be tethered to user ids possibly).
  * User pool: user based; handling user registration, authentication and account recovery.
    * Compatible IdPs: Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, OpenID Connect providers, SAML
  * Identity pool: receives authentication token to authorize access to resources directly or through the API GW.
    * Maps to IAM role(s)
    * default IAM role(s) for authenticated/guest users

### AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM):
  * Share AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts (within OU or any account)
  * Aids in avoiding resource duplication by sharing thing such as:
    * VPC subnets (owner can share +1 subnets with other accounts in the same OU):
      * Allows all resources (EC2, etc.) launched in the same VPC
      * Must be from the same OU
      * Can't share SGs and default VPC
      * Users can manage own resources, but can't modify, view, or delete other's resources
      * VPC by itself can't be shared
    * AWS Transit Gateway
    * Route 53 Resolver Rules
    * Licence Manager Configurations accross accounts using Private IP(s)

## Networking

### Load Balancers

#### Application Load Balancer (ALB):
  * Best suited for load balancing HTTP(s) traffic, operating @layer 7 (websockets)
  * HTTP traffic following the load balancer doesn't need encrpytion => port 80
  * Has a static DNS name (not ip) => uses private ip of associated ENI for requests forwarded to web server
  * Reserved ALB cookie names: AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG, AWSALB
  * Can load multiple SSL certificates on one listener that specifies the hostname via SNI
  * Redirects HTTP=>HTTPS
  * Target groups => EC2 (autoscale), ECS, Î», private ip address
  * Health checks are at the target group level
  * Routing based on url, hostname, query string paramters, or headers
  * X-Forwarded-For header for client ip
  * Sticky sessions available, via cookie (AWSALB)
  * Custom Cookie name must be specified for each target group (all cookies < 4KB)
  * Cross zone LB is free and disabled by default
  * Integrates with Cognito User Pools

#### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
  * Legacy load balancer that can load balance http(s) applications and use layer-7 specific features, such as X-Forwarded and sticky sessions
  * Can also use strict Layer 4 load balancing for applications that rely purely on TCP protocol
  * HTTP traffic following the load balancer doesn't need encrpytion => port 80
  * Has a static DNS name (not ip) => uses private ip of associated ENI for requests forwarded to web server
  * Health checks are TCP or HTTP
  * Sticky sessions available via cookie (AWS ELB) [all cookies < 4KB]
  * Cross zone LB is free and disabled by default
  * SNI not available, supports only one certificate

#### Gateway Load Balancer:
  * Used to scale, deploy, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS (eg: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention System[s], Deep Packet Inspection System[s], payload manipulation)
  * Operates @layer 3 (Network layer) ip packets
  * Combines *Transparent Network Gateway* - single entry/exit for all traffic and *Load Balancer* -distributes traffic to virtual appliances
  * Use Geneve protocol on port 6081
  * Target groups: EC2, private ip address(es)
  * Cross zone LB is $ per use and disabled by default

#### Network Load Balancer (NLB):
  * Best suited for load balancing of TCP/UDP traffic where extreme performance is required, operating @layer 4
  * Capable of handling millions of requests per second, while mantaining ultra-low latency
  * Has one static, public ip address per AZ (can attach elastic IP to this)
  * Can load multiple SSL certificates on one listener that specifies the hostname via SNI
  * Health checks are TCP or HTTP(S)
  * Target groups: EC2, private ip address(es), ALB
  * X-Forwarded-For header for client ip
  * Cross zone LB is $ per use and disabled by default
  * If targets specified via instance id => primary private ip specified in primary network interface
  * If targets specified via ip(s) => route traffic to instance via private ip from one or more network interfaces, allowing multiple applications to use the same point
  * Doesn't support SG(s), based on target configurations, ip of the client, or the *private ip address(es) of the NLB must be allowed on the web server's SG*

### Amazon CloudFront
  * Serverless service used to scale, save network bandwidth, and deliver entire website(s), including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content using a global network of edge locations, sending requests to nearest edge location through such options as:
   * Web distribution - websites (no architecture change)
   * RTMP - used for media streaming
   * Edge Location (Î»@edge) where content is cached.  Separate from an AWS Region/AZ.  Can be written to as well
   * Origin-origin of all files CDN distributes (S3 bucket, EC2, ELB, or Route 53)
   * Distribution - name given to CDN consisting of a collection of Edge Locations
  * Can route to multiple origins based on content type (dynamic => ELB, static => S3)
  * Options for securing content: https, geo restriction, signed url/cookie, field level encryption, AWS WAF
  * Can't be associated with SGs
  * Objects can be cached for TTL
  * Can clear cached objects, but you will be charged
  * Price classes: 
   * All Regions - best performance - $$$
   * 200 - $$
   * 100 - $ only least expensive regions
  * Supports primary/secondary origins for HA/failover (specific http responses)
  * Supports field level encryption (not KMS) @edge to protecte sensitive data
  * Serverless, cheaper to scale

### CloudFront Signed URLs/Cookies:
  * Use signed URLs/cookies when you want to secure content to authorized users
  * Signed URL is for 1 individual file 
  * Signed Cookie is for multiple files (sitewide)
  * If origin is EC2, use CloudFront Signed URLs/Cookies
  * If origin is S3, use S3 Signed URL (same IAM access as creator's IAM)
  * Policies:
   * Limited life time
   * IP ranges
   * Trusted signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLs)

### AWS PrivateLink:
  * Service allowing you to open your service in VPC to another VPC (using privatelink)
  * Allows exposure of VPC service to tens, hundres, or thousands of other VPCs
  * Doesn't require VPC peering; no route tables, NAT, IGWs, etc.
  * Requires a NLB on the service VPC and an ENI on the customer VPC
  * If issue(s): Check DNS setting Resolution in VPC and/or check the the Route Tables

### AWS Direct Connect
  * Service that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from on-premises to AWS VPC.  
  * Using Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS VPC and your datacenter/co-location environment, which can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet based connections
  * Can access private/public AWS resources
  * Useful for high throughput workloads (eg: lots of network traffic)
  * Good if you need a stable and reliable secure connection
  * Takes at least a month+ to setup
  * Supports IPV4/6
  * Can use Direct Connect Gateway if Direct Connect available between one VPC already

  * Can be shared across AWS Organization accounts

#### EC2 Reserved Instance:
  * Committed/consistent instance configuration, including instance type and region for a term of 1 or 3 years
  * Great for cost optimization
  * Can be shared across AWS Organization accounts
  * Can't be used for existing server-bound software licenses

#### EC2 Convertible Reserved Instance:
  * One of the reserved instance purchasing options (1 or 3 years)
  * Good for long workloads with flexible instance type(s)
  * Can change EC2 type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy

#### EC2 Dedicated Instance:
  * EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware dedicated to customer use
  * Physically isolated at the hose hardware level from instances belonging to other AWS accounts
  * May share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that aren't dedicated instances
  * Can't be used for existing server-bound software licenses

#### EC2 Dedicated Host Instance:
  * EC2 instances on physical servers dedicated for customer use
  * Give additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server over time
  * Enables the use of existing server-bound software licences and address compliance/regulatory requirements
  * On-demand option: pay per second ($$$)
  * Reserved option: 1 or 3 year options with other reserved instances ($ - $$)

#### EC2 Capacity Reserved Instance:
  * Reserve On-Demand capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
  * No time committment (create/cancel anytime); no billing discounts and charged On-Demand rate regardless
  * Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
  * Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that need to be in an AZ

#### EC2 Spot Instance:
  * Most cost-efficient EC2 instance, up to 90% off On-Demand rate
  * Can lose at any time if your max price < the current spot price
  * Not suitable for critical jobs or DBs
  * Useful for jobs such as: batch jobs, data analysis, image processing, any distributed workloads, workloads with a flexible start/end time
  * Can only cancel Spot Requests that are open, active or disabled.  Cancelling a Spot Request doesn't terminate the instances; you must first cancel the Spot Request and then terminate the Spot Instances
  * Don't use if being up for a specific time frame is necessary

#### EC2 Spot Fleets:
  * set of Spot Instances and optional On-Demand Instances
  * Will try to meet target capacity with price constraints defined via possible launch pools, instance type, OS, AZ
  * Can have multiple launch pools from which the fleet can choose
  * Stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
  * Allow automatically to request Spot Instances with the lowest price
  * Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
    * *Lowest Price*: from the pool with lowest price (cost optimization, short workloads)
    * *Diversified*: distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
    * *Capacity Optimized*: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances

#### EC2 Spot Blocks (aka Spot Duration):
  * "block" spot instance during a specified time frame (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions
  * In rare situations, instance may be reclaimed
  * Not available to new customers

    * Single ipv4 (/32 CIDR) or ipv6 (/128 CIDR)
    * Range of ipv4/ipv6 address (CIDR block notation)
    * Prefix List ID for the AWS service(s) via Gatway Endpoints, (eg: p1-1a2b3c4d)
    * Another SG, allowing instances within one SG to access instances within another.  Choosing this option doesn't add rules from the source SG, to the 'linked' SG.  You can specify one of the following:
     * Current SG
     * Different SG for the the same VPC
     * Different SG for a peer VPC in VPC peering connection

### EC2 Placement Groups

#### Cluster Placement Group:
  * Clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single AZ
  * Great network speeds (10 GBps bandwidth between instances with enhanced networking enabled; recommended)
  * If the rack fails, all instances fail at once
  * Use cases:
    * Big data job that needs to complete fast
    * Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput

#### Partition Placement Group:
  * Spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ
  * Scales to 100s of instances per group
  * Up to 7 partitions per AZ and can span multiple AZs in the same region
    * Instances in a partition don't share racks with the instances in other partitions
    * Individual partition failure can affect many EC2, but won't affect other partitions
    * EC2 instances get access to the partition meta data
  * Use cases: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka, Hadoop (distributed and replicated workloads)

#### Spread Placement Group:
  * Spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ)
  * Can span across AZs
  * Reduced risk of simultaneous failure
  * EC2 instances on different physical hardware
  * Use cases:
    * Maximal HA
    * Critical Application where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other

### EC2 Instance Recovery: same private IP, public IP, elastic IP, metadata, placement group, instance ID after failure

### EC2 User Data:
  * Used to perform common automated, dynamic, configuration tasks and even run scripts after and instance starts
  * When an EC2 launches, you can pass 2 types of user data, shell script(s) and cloud-init directives .  This can be passed into the launch wizard as plain text or a file
  * *By default, shell scripts entered as user data are executed with root priveleges (no sudeo command necessary)*
  * If non-root users are to have file access, modify the permissions accordingly via shell scripting
  * *By default, user data runs only during the boot cycle when the EC2 is first launched*
  * Alternatively, configuation(s) can be updated to ensure user data scripts and cloud init directives can run every time an EC2 instance is restarted

### EC2 Hibernate:
  * In-memory state is preserved
  * Instance boot time is much faster (OS is not stopped/restarted)
  * Memory state is written to a file in root EBS
  * Root EBS must be encrypted
  * Can't use hibernate beyond 60 days

  * Rules are applied to new resources as they are created (good for compliance) across all and future accounts in Organization

### AWS Network Firewall:
  * Protect your entire Amazon VPC with a firewall from *layer 3 to layer 7 protection*
  * Traffic filtering: Allow, drop, alert to rule matches
  * Can be centrally managed cross-account/VPC by AWS Firewall Manager
  * Can inspect:
    * To/From traffic
    * Outbound to/Inbound from the internet
    * VPC to VPC traffic
    * To, From Direct Connect and Site to Site VPN
  * Internally, AWS Network Firewall uses the AWS Gateway Load Balancer
  * Supports 1000s of rules
  * IP and port blocking
  * Protocol (eg: block SMB outbound traffic)
  * Stateful domain list rule groups (eg: allow outbound traffic to *.mysite.com or 3rd party software repository)
  * Regex pattern matching
  * Active flow inspection to protect against network threats with Intrusion prevention capabilities
  * Sends logs of rule matches to S3, Cloudwatch logs, Kinesis Data Firehose

### WAF vs Firewall Manager vs Shield:
  * All used together for comprehensive protection
  * Define your Web ACL rules in WAF
  * For granular protection of your resources, WAF alone is the correct choice
  * If you want to use AWS WAF across accounts, accelerate WAF configuration, automate the protection of new resources, use Firewall Manager with AWS WAF
  * Shield Advanced adds additional features on top of AWS WAF such as dedicated support from the Shield Response Team (SRT) and advanced reporting
  * If prone to frequent DDOS=>Shield Advanced

### Security Groups (SGs):
  * Stateful connection, allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports, thus enabling the connection
  * If adding an Internet Gateway, ensure the SG allows traffic in
  * SG => EC2 instances level, LBs, EFS, DBs, Elasticache
  * Allow rules only

### NACL Groups:
  * Stateless, thus a source port inbound will become the outbound port (or possibly taking the defined port and responding via an ephemeral port)
  * Great way of allowing/blocking ip addresses at the subnet level
  * Like a firewall controlling to/from subnet traffic
  * One NACL per subnet
  * New Subnet automatically set to default NACL which denies all inbound/outbound traffic
  * Do not modify default NACL, instead create custom NACL(s)
  * If accepting internet traffic routed via internet gateway
  * If accepting vpn or AWS Direct Connect traffic routed via Virtual Private Gateway
  * NACL rules:
    * Range from 1-32766, with a higher precedence placed on lower numbers
    * Allow and Deny rules
    * First rule match drives acceptance/denial
    * Last rule match is a catch all (\*) and denies a request in case no rules match
    * AWS recommends adding rules by an increment of 100

## VPC

### Launch Configuration (tenancy vs VPC tenancy):
  * Part of the instance config launching instances distributed across physical hardware
  * Tenancy (instance placement) default is null and the instance tenancy is controlled by the tenancy attribute of the VPC
  * Shared (default): multiple AWS accounts may share the same physical hardware
  * Dedicated Instance (dedicated): single tenant hardware used
  * Dedicated Host (host): instances run on a physical server with EC2 instance fully dedicated to a given client's use (not available for launch template configuration)

| Launch Configuration Tenancy | VPC tenancy=default | VPC tenancy=dedicated |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| null | shared | dedicated |
| default | shared | dedicated |
| dedicated | dedicated | dedicated |

### Amazon VPC console wizard configurations:
  * VPC with public/private subnets (NA)
  * VPC with public/private subnets and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access
  * VPC with a single public subnet
  * VPC with a private subnet only and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access
  
### VPC Traffic Mirroring:
  * Allows you to capture/inspect network traffic in VPC
  * Route the traffic to security appliance(s) you manage
  * Capture the traffic: -From (source) ENIs -To (Target) an ENI or NLB
  * Capture all packets or packets of interest (optionally truncating packets)
  * Source and target can be the same or different VPCs (VPC peering)
  

### Direct Connect Gateways: Enables connections to many VPCs in different AWS regions

#### Vitual Private Gateway:
  * VPN Connector on the AWS side of the VPN connection
  * Created and attached to the VPC from which you want to create site-to-site-VPN
  * Necessary for setting up AWS Direct Connect

#### AWS VPN (AWS Site-to-Site VPN):
  * Establish on-ongoing VPN connection between on-premises data center (customer gateway) and Amazon VPC (VGW)
  * Utilizes IPSec (encrypted tunnel) to establish encrypted network connectivity between your internet and Amazon VPC over the internet
  * Connection can be configured in minutes and is a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements and can tolerate the inherent variability of Internet-based connectivity
  * Need to configure VGW and Customer Gateway
  * Ensure Route Propagation enabled for VGW in the route table associated with your subnets
  * If ping needed (EC2) from on-premises, add ICMP protocol on the inbound SGs
### Transit VPC:
  * Uses customer managed EC2(s) VPN instances in a dedicated transit VPC resources with an IGW
  * Data transfer charged for traffic traversing this VPC an again from the transit VPC to on-premises network or different AWS regions
  * Consider AWS Transit Gateway (shared services VPC) as a cheaper and less maintenance alternative

### VPC Peering: 
  * Privately connects 2 VPCs on AWS's network, behaving as if the same network (works in different AWS accounts/regions)
  * Must not a have overlapping CIDRs
  * Not transitive (must be established for each VPC to communicate)
  * Must update route tables in each VPCs subnets to ensure communication between each's EC2 instance

### AWS Transit Gateway (Shared services VPC):
  * Allows transitive peering between thousands of VPCs and on-premises data centers
  * Works on a hub-and-spoke model
  * Works primarily on a regional basis, though accessible acorss multiple regions
  * Can be used across multiple AWS accounts using AWS RAM
  * Can use route tables to limit VPCs communication between one another
  * Works with Direct Connect as well as VPN connections
  * Supports IP multicast (not supported by any other AWS service)
  * Site-to-site VPN ECMP: creates multiple connections to increase bandwidth of connection to AWS

### Internet Gateway (IGW):
  * Allows resources (EC2, etc.) in a VPC to connect to the internet (IPV4/6) via route table
  * Scales horizontally, is HA and redundant
  * One VPC per IGW
  * VPC route tables need to be edited to allow internet access
  * Can't be used directly in a private subnet without NAT instance or gateway in a public subnet
  * If subnet hooked via route table up to the IGW => public
  * Acts as (NAT) for instances that are assigned public IPV4 address(es)
  * Must be created separately from a VPC

### NAT Gateway:
  * Used in a *public subnet* in a VPC, enabling instances in a *private subnet* to initiate outbound IPV4 traffic to the internet/other AWS services, but prevents inbound traffic to instances from the internet
  * Fully managed by AWS
  * Tied to AZ/subnet(s), eg: can't span multiple AZ, multiple NGW are necessary for fault tolerance/failover
  * Uses an Elastic IP
  * Requires IGW (Private subnet => NATGW => IGW)
  * No SG
  * Can't be used by EC2 in the same subnet

### NAT Instance:
  * Used in a *public subnet* in a VPC, enables instances in a *private subnet* to initiate outbound IPV4 to the internet/other AWS services, but prevents inbound traffic to instances from the internet
  * Can be used as a bastion host/server
  * Allows port forwarding
  * Managed by user (software, patches, etc.)
  * Tied to AZ/subnet(s), eg: can't span multiple AZ
  * Must disable EC2 setting: Source/Destination check
  * Must have an Elastic IP
  * Route tables need configuration to route traffic from private subnets to the NAT instance
  * Must manage SG and rules: 
    * *Inbound*-HTTP(S) from private subnets, allow SSH from the home network
    * *Outbound*-HTTP(S) to the internet

### VPC Endpoint:
  * Every AWS service is publicly exposed (public url)
  * VPC Endpoints (using AWS PrivateLink) allows connections to AWS service(s) using a private network instead of public internet
  * Redundant and scales horizontally
  * Removes the need for IGW, NATGW, etc. to access AWS service(s)
  * In case of issues: 
    * Check DNS setting resolution in VPC 
    * Check Route tables
  * Types of Endpoints:
    * Interface Endpoints: provisions an ENI (private ip) as an entry point (must attach a SG); supports most AWS services; powered by Private Link
    * Gateway Endpoints: provisions a gateway and must be used as a target in Route table; supports both *S3 and DynamoDB*
  * Gateway Endpoints are preferred most of the time over Interface Endpoints as the former is free and the latter costs $
  * Interface endpoint is preferred if access is required from on-premises (site-to-site VPN or Direct Connect), a different VPC or a different region

### VPC Flow Logs:
  * Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces, such as Subnet Flow Logs or ENI Flow Logs
  * Helps to monitor/troubleshoot connectivity issues
  * Can go to S3 or Cloudwatch Logs
  * Capture network information from AWS managed interfaces, too: ELB, RDS, Elasticache, Redshift, Workspaces, NATGW, Transit Gateway
  * Query via Athena on S3 or Cloudwatch Log Insights (good for troubleshooting SG and NACL issues)

### Bastion Host/Server
  * An EC2 used to SSH into private EC2 instances
  * Is the public subnet which is connected to all other private subnets
  * SG must be tightened
  * Should only have port 22 on the public CIDR available
  * NAT instances can be used as a bastion server/host
  * SG should only allow inbound from the internet on port 22
  * SG of instances must allow SG of the Bastion Host or the private ip of the Bastion host access
  
### Egress-only Internet Gateway:
  * Similar to NAT Gateway, but for ipv6 only
  * Allows instances in VPC outbound connections over ipv6 while preventing the internet to initiate an ipv6 connection to your instance(s)
  * Must update route tables

## Storage

EBS:
  * Volumes exist on EBS => virtual hard disk
  * Snapshots exist on S3 (point in time copy of disk)
  * Snapshots are incremental-only the blocks that have changed since the last snapshot are move to S3
  * First snapshot might take more time
  * Best to stop root EBS device to take snapshots, though you don't have to
  * Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS [io1/io2])=> DB workloads/multi-attach
  * Multi-attach (EC2 =>rd/wr)=>attach the same EBS to multiple EC2 in the same AZ; up to 16 (all in the same AZ)
  * Can change volume size and storage type on the fly
  * Always in the same region as EC2
  * To move EC2 volume=>snapshot=>AMI=>copy to destination Region/AZ=>launch AMI

  * *Throughput mode*: 
    * Bursting (1 TB = 50 MiB/s and burst of up to 100 MiB/s)
    * Provisioned-set your throughput regardless of storage size (eg 1 GiB/s for 1 TB storage)
  * *Storage Classes*, Storage Tiers (lifecycle management=>move file after N days):
    * Standard: for frequently accessed files
    * Infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
  * *Availability and durability*: 
    * Standard: multi-AZ, great for production
    * One Zone: great for development, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone-IA)
